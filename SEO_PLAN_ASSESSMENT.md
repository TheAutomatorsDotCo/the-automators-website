## Assessment Logic & Scoring

### Scoring System

**Points Allocation**:
```
Time Spent on Admin (Q1):
- Less than 5 hours = 10 points
- 5-10 hours = 25 points
- 10-20 hours = 50 points
- 20+ hours = 75 points

Repetitive Tasks (Q2):
- Each selected = 10 points
- Multiple selections = higher automation potential

Pain Points (Q3):
- Weighted by automation suitability
- "Can't scale" = high score
- "Too time-consuming" = high score

Tools Used:
- More tools = higher integration opportunity
- Disconnected systems = higher score

etc.
```

**Readiness Score Calculation**:
```
Total Points / Maximum Possible × 100 = Readiness Score

Score Ranges:
- 0-30: "Getting Started" - Basic automation recommended
- 31-60: "Ready to Grow" - Multiple automations beneficial
- 61-85: "High Potential" - Significant automation opportunities
- 86-100: "Critical Need" - Automation essential for scaling
```

**Time Savings Calculation**:
```
Base savings = Hours on admin × automation percentage
Automation percentage based on:
- Tasks selected (40-60% typically automatable)
- Current tools (integration opportunities)
- Team size (collaboration potential)
- Process complexity

Example:
- 20 hours/week on admin
- 50% automation potential
- = 10 hours/week saved
```

**Cost Savings Calculation**:
```
Annual cost of current process:
Hours × 52 weeks × average hourly rate

Automation cost:
One-time implementation + optional maintenance

Savings:
Annual current cost - automation cost = first year savings
Annual current cost = ongoing annual savings (years 2+)

ROI Timeline:
Automation cost / weekly savings / average billing value = weeks to ROI
```

## Notes
- Assessment is powerful lead generation tool - optimize for completion
- Keep it genuinely valuable - focus on helping, not just collecting emails
- 2-minute completion time is critical - don't add unnecessary questions
- Results must be specific and actionable - generic results kill trust
- Multiple CTA options accommodate different commitment levels
- Email capture should be optional - provide value first
- Track abandonment points to optimize weak questions
- Mobile experience is critical - many will take on phone
- Results page is highest-intent traffic - optimize CTAs heavily
- Consider A/B testing extensively - small improvements = big impact
- Retake functionality allows users to explore different scenarios
- Comparison to peers/averages makes results more meaningful
- PDF export adds perceived value and provides leave-behind
- Follow-up sequence should be helpful, not salesy
- Consider adding "Compare to industry averages" feature
- Social sharing could provide viral growth opportunity
